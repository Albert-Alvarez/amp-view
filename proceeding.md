This section will help you to start using your AmpVIEW software. Read carefully these specifications before you start to use the device.

By starting the application, a new window will appear like the figure shown below.

![AmpVIEW software]({{ "/assets/img/captura-ampview.jpg" | relative_url }})

The window can be simply divided in two parts. At the right side, there is the graph where the values of the measurement will appear consecutively. The graph shows the current (in Amperes) with respect to time (in seconds). At the left side, there are the different control elements and parameters to configure your measurement.

From top to bottom, you have:

+ **Start Measurement**: Click on this button to start your measurement. Before this, make sure that you have connected correctly your device to the computer.  
Once started running the measurement, you can always stop it by clicking again on the same button, now called **stop measurement**. Remind that you have to stop the measurement process before leaving the software.

+ **Export Data**: This option allows you to export the data from the measurement to an Excel sheet.

+ **Pretreatment parameters**: Here, you can select the parameters you want to set before the measurement. You can change the parameters by entering them with your keyboard or with the arrows.
    + **Time**: This corresponds to the time you want to wait until the beginning of the measurement. It is configured in seconds.
    + **Voltage**: This is the voltage previous to the measurement. You can set values from 0 to 0.3V. 

+ **Measurement parameters**: This is the configuration of the device for meaurement. As in the previous point, you can vary the time and voltage parameters.  
    + **Time**: this is the time, in seconds, that you desire to run the measurement.
    + **Voltage**: the voltage that you want to apply during the measurement. Remind that the value has to be between 0 and 0.3V.
